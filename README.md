# Detectie_vibratie

This project aims to create a vibration detection system, using an ESP32 and a Hall effect sensor. It works based on the movement of a magnet. By fixing the sensor and the magnet inside a box, vibrations can be detected when the box is shaken, and the corresponding plot is displayed on a web page with authentification for separate users.
